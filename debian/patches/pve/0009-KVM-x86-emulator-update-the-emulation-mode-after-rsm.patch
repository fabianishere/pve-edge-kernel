Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: emulator: update the emulation mode after rsm

This ensures that RIP will be correctly written back,
because the RSM instruction can switch the CPU mode from
32 bit (or less) to 64 bit.

This fixes a guest crash in case the #SMI is received
while the guest runs a code from an address > 32 bit.
