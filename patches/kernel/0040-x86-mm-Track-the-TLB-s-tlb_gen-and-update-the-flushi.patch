Subject: [PATCH] x86/mm: Track the TLB's tlb_gen and update the flushing
 algorithm
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

CVE-2017-5754

There are two kernel features that would benefit from tracking
how up-to-date each CPU's TLB is in the case where IPIs aren't keeping
it up to date in real time:

 - Lazy mm switching currently works by switching to init_mm when
   it would otherwise flush.  This is wasteful: there isn't fundamentally
   any need to update CR3 at all when going lazy or when returning from
   lazy mode, nor is there any need to receive flush IPIs at all.  Instead,
   we should just stop trying to keep the TLB coherent when we go lazy and,
   when unlazying, check whether we missed any flushes.

 - PCID will let us keep recent user contexts alive in the TLB.  If we
   start doing this, we need a way to decide whether those contexts are
   up to date.

On some paravirt systems, remote TLBs can be flushed without IPIs.
This won't update the target CPUs' tlb_gens, which may cause
unnecessary local flushes later on.  We can address this if it becomes
a problem by carefully updating the target CPU's tlb_gen directly.

By itself, this patch is a very minor optimization that avoids
unnecessary flushes when multiple TLB flushes targetting the same CPU
race.  The complexity in this patch would not be worth it on its own,
but it will enable improved lazy TLB tracking and PCID.

+	 *
+	 *    As an example of why this check is needed, suppose that there

+	 *    flush that changes context.tlb_gen from 2 to 3.  If they get
+	 *    processed on this CPU in reverse order, we'll see
+	 *     local_tlb_gen == 1, mm_tlb_gen == 3, and end != TLB_FLUSH_ALL.
+	 *    If we were to use __flush_tlb_single() and set local_tlb_gen to
+	 *    3, we'd be break the invariant: we'd update local_tlb_gen above
+	 *    1 without the full flush that's needed for tlb_gen 2.
+	 *
+	 * 2. f->new_tlb_gen == mm_tlb_gen.  This is purely an optimiation.
+	 *    Partial TLB flushes are not all that much cheaper than full TLB
+	 *    flushes, so it seems unlikely that it would be a performance win
+	 *    to do a partial flush if that won't bring our TLB fully up to
+	 *    date.  By doing a full flush instead, we can increase
