Subject: [PATCH 225/241] x86/pti: Switch to kernel CR3 at early in
 entry_SYSCALL_compat()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

CVE-2017-5754

The preparation for PTI which added CR3 switching to the entry code
misplaced the CR3 switch in entry_SYSCALL_compat().

With PTI enabled the entry code tries to access a per cpu variable after
switching to kernel GS. This fails because that variable is not mapped to
user space. This results in a double fault and in the worst case a kernel
crash.

Move the switch ahead of the access and clobber RSP which has been saved
already.

Fixes: 8a09317b895f ("x86/mm/pti: Prepare the x86/entry assembly code for entry/exit CR3 switching")
